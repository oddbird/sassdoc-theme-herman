Herman [a SassDoc theme]
========================

At [OddBird][oddbird],
we wanted to a tool to help us
document the entire front end of a project,
from brand guidelines to UX Elements and code patterns.
Herman is our odd [SassDoc][SassDoc] theme,
still in alpha-development,
with a number of extra features for documenting
user-experience and code patterns:

- Font specimens
- Color palettes
- SVG icon previews
- Referencing & rendering Jinja/Nunjucks macros from the Sass docs
- more on the way!

Getting Started
---------------

```
npm install sassdoc-theme-herman
```

See the [SassDoc documentation](http://sassdoc.com/getting-started/)
for how to install SassDoc and run it via various build tools.

Herman is a theme for SassDoc,
so you'll want to specify `herman`
as the theme in your `sassdoc` options.


Rendering `nunjucks` examples
-----------------------------

If you use an `@example` annotation with the `njk` language,
Herman will display both the source code of the example
and its rendered output.

This makes it possible to show examples of markup patterns
that make use of styles in your Sass.

For example, this:

	// Test Macro
	// ----------
	// This is a test.
	/// @example njk - Basic usage:
	///  {% import 'macros.j2' as macros %}
	///  {{ macros.mymacro(1, 2) }}
	/// @group test
	[data-mymacro] {}

will render the `mymacro` macro from the file `macros.j2`
(which happens to use the `[data-mymacro]` attribute).

In order for this to work,
you must also either specify a `templatepath`
(the path where nunjucks will look to import templates),
or a `nunjucksEnv` (a custom nunjucks environment â€”
this is particularly useful if your macros contain custom filters)
in your `sassdoc` options.


Development
-----------

To install the necessary Node dependencies, run ``npm install``.

You can lint the project's JS with ``gulp eslint`` and run the JS unit tests
with ``gulp jstest`` (or ``npm test``). You can lint Sass with
``gulp sasslint``.

To compile and minify the static assets--as well as generate the
documentation--run ``gulp compile``.

Just running ``gulp`` will perform all of the above tasks.

You can start up a local development server with ``gulp develop``. This will
also watch for changes to local files and automatically perform an appropriate
selection of the above tasks whenever changes are detected to relevant files.

Access the running server at http://localhost:3000.

Refer to the ``gulpfile.js`` source and `gulp`_ documentation for more info.
